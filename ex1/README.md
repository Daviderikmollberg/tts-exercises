# Create a reading list
Your task is to maximize diphone coverage in a list of 500 sentences. The coverage is 100% if all diphones appear in your reading list. You can use any method you like to achieve this.

## Notes
* Picking the longest sentences is likely to be a good strategy (since they will contain the highest number of phonemes) but do note that you will be reading the sentences. Take some time to carefully consider how you could maximize diphone coverage while minimizing sentence length.
* A base corpus of approximately 27K sentences is included under `./data` which you reading list will be sourced from.
* A list of diphones in IPA format is also found under `./data`.
* `example.py` contains examples of how to retrieve the corpus and diphones.
